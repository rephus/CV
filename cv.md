## Working experience

### Stacker ( 2019-01 / - )
<!--
Started: 2019-01

-->
I joined Stacker as a full stack engineer at a very early stage, so we experienced some iterations in the product. It was a very challening and exciting product to work on, since the goal to allow non technical users to build their own apps was not an easy task; nor from the product point of view (no one has cracked the magic formula yet) or from a technical point of view. We had to design a very dynamic API that could not be tied to a specific schema or configuration, with several generic layers (like permissions or roles), as well as a data cache to keep it performant.              

#### Higlights

* Technologies: Google cloud, Kubernetes, React, Python Django, Celery, Postgres, Memcached
* I was in charge of devops: I designed and maintained Kubernetes clusters for staging and production

### Lantum ( 2017-04 / 2019-01 )
<!--
Started: 2017-04
Finished: 2019-01

Lantum hired me as a contractor to design, maintain their python microservice architecture on Kubernetes in AWS. 
Eventually I started also making changes to the frontend code built in Angular. 

#### Higlights

* Technologies: AWS, Angular, Python, Kubernetes
* I was in charge of devops: I designed and maintained Kubernetes staging and prod clusters

### Network Locum ( 2015-12 / 2017-04 )

<!--
Started: 2015-12
Finished: 2017-04
-->
Smart team of people with different approaches to work.
We all worked really hard on doing a codebase refactor in 6 weeks,
defining and creating from scratch all the existing platform features
in new Django, Flask docker microservices.
We then shifted to a squads-based structure, and I joined the one in
charge of the billing process.

#### Higlights

* Full microservices architecture using Docker and Rancher
* Input on important architectural decissions
* Backend mostly built in Python3, Django and Flask (and a bit of Scala) with PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence
* TDD and BDD
* Continuous integration using Jenkins and Travis
* Conducted software developer interviews

### Top10 ( 2013-05 / 2015-12 )

<!--
Started: 2013-05
Finished: 2015-12
-->
It was a small startup with a team of top-talent engineers,
I had the chance to vastly improve my knowledge both in new technologies
and good code practices.

#### Higlights

* Backend microservices development in Scala
* Full custom CMS app built in Scala (Play Framework)
* CI with Jenkins
* Polyglot persistence with Cassandra, Memcached, ElasticSearch, Redis
* Heavy use of Amazon WS (DynamoDB, EC2, S3, SQS, SNS, etc)

### Openbet Ltd.  ( 2012-10 / 2013-05 )

<!--
Started: 2012-10
Finished: 2013-05
-->

While the codebase and project was not very flashy, I learned how it feels working in a large company with a large team and I also was introduced to agile (standups, code reviews)

#### Highlights

* Web backend development for sportsbook sites in Tcl
* Troubleshooting, QA, optimization and code analysis for existing products
* Automation scripts in Bash and Expect in Jenkins.
* Release manager: in charge or the team's code merging, code deployment, and direct support towards clients

### Asesores Locales Consultoria S.A. ( 2009-07 / 2012-09 )

<!--
Started: 2009-07
Finished: 2012-09
-->


Asesores Locales was my first job as a developer.
I started by learning some basics on JEE and web development, but fueled by
my motivation, after the cuourse of my time there I ended up leading development
of some projects, bringing new technology, and mentoring others
(I was the official "innovator geek mind" in the company).

#### Highlights

* JEE development in several projects, as part of teams and autonomously
* UI with IceFaces, Jboss Richfaces, ADF and Woodstock frameworks
* GIS system development in JEE using MapServer for custom street location service
* Devops: Installation, configuration and maintenance of IBM servers with Windows Server 2008 R2, CentOS and VMWare VSphere hypervisor 5.0 
* Administration of Oracle, MySQL and PostgreSQL databases
* Application servers Glassfish v2/v3 and Oracle weblogic
* Product presentations (inside and outside the company)
* Manager role in some projects

## Strengths

* Very efficient developer, multi-tasker, right balance between speed and test coverage.
* Can-do attitude.
* Likes to have a good overview of the global architecture, from the backend to the frontend, including databases, APIs, DNS and servers.
* Special focus on performance: able to identify, find and fix bottlenecks.
* Enthusiast and curious: continously learning and trying new technologies and languages on my spare time
* Motivation to solve difficult problems and build complex features
* Extremely friendly person, excellent working with teams, as well as independently

## Personal projects

I am constantly playing with technology in my spare time, including
not only application development but also hardware projects and games.
You can see my full portfolio on [Coconauts.net](http://coconauts.net/projects), and [Github.com/rephus](https://github.com/rephus)
but some of the highlights include

* [My own podcast](http://coconauts.net/projects/podcast/) about development (in spanish)
* [StarCraft Unity3D](http://coconauts.net/projects/starcraft-unity3d/) RTS template optimized for mobile, built in Unity3D inspired in StarCraft
* [Retrophies](http://html5.coconauts.net/retrophies), a web emulator of NES games with Achievements and multiplayer gameplay via websockets.
  and multiplayer gameplay with websockets, featured on Hackernews.
* [Watchduino](http://coconauts.net/projects/watchduino2/), a smartwatch based
  on Arduino with Bluetooth communication and companion app for Android.
  Finalist on the Hackaday Prize 2015.
* Casual mobile videogames released for Android platform since v1.6 [android](http://coconauts.net/blog/tags/android/)
* [Gramola](http://coconauts.net/projects/gramola/), a web-based music player written in Node.js
