            <p>I'm a senior software engineer with over 12 years of experience. 
               I specialize in backend web development, but 
               I have experience and a good understanding of the full stack,
                from frontend to devops. 
                I'm most productive at present with the Typescript, Python and Scala ecosystems, 
                however I consider myself to be technology-agnostic,
                 and can quickly adapt to any language and framework.
            </p>
            <p>Most of my professional experience has been with startups in London. I enjoy the thrill of building something brand new, plus the fast paced environment and good vives with a small and dedicated team.

            <p>During my spare time I am also constantly learning new technologies and building pet projects of very different natures: from web apps to videogames to mobile apps to electronics. I share them in my blog,

                 I joined Pashi as a technical leader.
                 I was in charge of maintaining, updating, bugfixing the main codebase, 
                 while I was building a brand new interface and backend for extending the compatibility of the product with 
                 multiple production line types, using no-code principles.

               Stacker aims to build a revolutionary service following no-code principles that will allow non technical users to build their own portals by just importing their data from Airtable or Google sheets.

                 <h3>Insight</h3>
                 I joined Stacker as a full stack engineer at a very early stage, 
                 so we experienced some iterations in the product. 
                 It was a very challenging and exciting product to work on, 
                 since the goal to allow non technical users to build their own apps 
                 was not an easy task; nor from the product point of view 
                 (no one has cracked the magic formula yet) or from a technical point
                  of view. 
                  We had to design a very dynamic API that could not be tied to a 
                  specific schema or configuration, with several generic layers
                   (like permissions or roles), as well as a data cache to keep 
                   it performant.

Smart team of people with different approaches to work. We all worked really hard on
               doing a codebase refactor in 6 weeks, defining and creating from scratch all the existing platform
               features in new Django, Flask docker microservices. We then shifted to a squads-based structure,
               and I joined the one in charge of the billing process.

               Asesores Locales was my first job as a developer.
               I started by learning some basics on JEE and web development, but fueled by
               my motivation, after the cuourse of my time there I ended up leading development
               of some projects, bringing new technology, and mentoring others
               (I was the official "innovator geek mind" in the company).
               <h3>Hightlights</h3>

                <p>Javier has been our most productive developer over the past year.
                    Notably, Javier has been reliably productive in both high and low morale environments.
                     He's a great, friction-less team member - he always has cool side projects to share.
                    Javier has a systematic approach, and he delivers consistent, well-tested code. 
                    He always has a great local dev environment setup, and combined with fast iterations on unit and integration tests, 
                    makes you feel very productive pair-programming with Javier.</p>

                    Aside from his technical skills, Javier is an absolutely brilliant guy to have in the team with a positive, 
                    can-do attitude, a great sense of humour and unbridled enthusiasm for technology.

                <p>Javier and I worked together in NetworkLocum. We were backend colleagues.
                    He‚Äôs a top-notch engineer, and a model I tried to follow while working with him.
                    He had more experience than me in the environment and in the company, 
                    he has been always supportive and willing to help, not only me but everyone around.
                    His standards of quality are quite high,
                    and he is always trying to improve the test environments and promoting best practices.</p>
