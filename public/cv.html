<p>I joined Stacker as a full stack engineer at a very early stage, so we experienced some iterations in the product. It was a very challening and exciting product to work on, since the goal to allow non technical users to build their own apps was not an easy task; nor from the product point of view (no one has cracked the magic formula yet) or from a technical point of view. We had to design a very dynamic API that could not be tied to a specific schema or configuration, with several generic layers (like permissions or roles), as well as a data cache to keep it performant.</p>
<h4 id="higlights">Higlights</h4>

<li>Technologies: Google cloud, Kubernetes, React, Python Django, Celery, Postgres, Memcached</li>

<p>Lantum hired me as a contractor to design, maintain their python microservice architecture on Kubernetes in AWS. Eventually I started also making changes to the frontend code built in Angular.</p>

<p>Smart team of people with different approaches to work. We all worked really hard on doing a codebase refactor in 6 weeks, defining and creating from scratch all the existing platform features in new Django, Flask docker microservices. We then shifted to a squads-based structure, and I joined the one in charge of the billing process.</p>
<h4 id="higlights-2">Higlights</h4>
<ul>
<li>Full microservices architecture using Docker and Rancher</li>
<li>Input on important architectural decissions</li>
<li>Backend mostly built in Python3, Django and Flask (and a bit of Scala) with PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence</li>
<li>TDD and BDD</li>
<li>Continuous integration using Jenkins and Travis</li>
<li>Conducted software developer interviews</li>

<p>It was a small startup with a team of top-talent engineers, I had the chance to vastly improve my knowledge both in new technologies and good code practices.</p>
